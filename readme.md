# slang 🐕‍🦺

    goal was to learn how a interpreter works,  in other works who does these programing languages i use on daily basis works behind the seen  how a variable is assigned it's value and other things in the same realm.

## why Go ?

    before this i mainly worked with scripting language other than java. the gofmt and binary file output are the main reasons though.

## can i use this language ?

### NO

    this barely even compare to the stepping stones of a daily driven language like go or js. it exists only so that someone can read and understand how a language works under the hood.
